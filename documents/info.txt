OpenSeaMap Charts 

This KAP bundle was created by the OpenSeaMap Project. The charts are based on 
data provided from openstreetmap [5] and openseamap project [1]. 
You can use the openCPN application to show the charts on PC based hardware or 
on android phone/tablet. Read openCPN documentation for installation procedure
of the chart bundles [6]. 

Please note that the maps may contain errors and are not always up-to-date. 
Consider that good seamanship requires the use of official nautical charts. 
OpenSeaMap is for use with other charts and cannot replace official charts. 
Use is at your own risk.[7] 

Please feel free to use the openseamap forum if you have questions or notes 
according to the charts (https://forum.openseamap.org/).
